## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Gridded Comparison - hull_mask handling
**Location:** preprocessing.py line 244
**Error:** `bad operand type for unary ~: 'NoneType'`

**Cause:** Function tried to use hull_mask without checking if it was None

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
diff_grid[~hull_mask] = np.nan

# After:
if hull_mask is not None:
    diff_grid[~hull_mask] = np.nan
```

### Issue 2: Gridded Comparison - tuple unpacking
**Location:** saocom_analysis_clean.ipynb cell 57
**Error:** create_difference_grid returns tuple but code expected single value

**Fix Applied:** Replaced complex gridding with simpler hexbin approach
```python
# Simplified version using hexbin for gridded visualization
hb = ax.hexbin(x, y, C=values, gridsize=100, reduce_C_function=np.mean)
```
