# Visualizations Added to saocom_analysis_clean.ipynb

## Summary

Added **11 major visualization sections** to the clean notebook while maintaining its readable, well-documented format.

## New Section 12: Additional Visualizations

All new visualizations are organized under "Section 12: Additional Visualizations" with clear subsections:

### 12.1 Spatial Coverage Map
- Shows SAOCOM points overlaid with TINItaly DEM extent
- Study area convex hull
- Verifies spatial overlap
- **Output:** `spatial_coverage.png`

### 12.2 Gridded Comparison Analysis
- Creates gridded difference maps (SAOCOM - TINItaly, SAOCOM - Copernicus)
- Shows spatial patterns of height differences
- **Output:** `gridded_comparison.png`

### 12.3 Hexbin Density Plots
- Density visualization of SAOCOM vs reference DEMs
- Shows data clustering patterns
- Includes 1:1 reference lines
- **Output:** `hexbin_density.png`

### 12.4 2D Histograms
- Alternative density visualization
- Histogram binning of height comparisons
- **Output:** `hist2d_comparison.png`

### 12.5 Violin Plots - Accuracy by Slope
- Detailed distribution of residuals for each terrain type
- Shows full statistical distribution (not just mean/median)
- Compares Flat, Gentle, Moderate, and Steep terrain
- **Output:** `violin_plot_slope.png`

### 12.6 Residuals vs Coherence
- Scatter plots showing relationship between coherence and accuracy
- Investigates if higher coherence = better accuracy
- Separate plots for TINItaly and Copernicus
- **Output:** `residuals_vs_coherence.png`

### 12.7 Terrain Slope Map
- Visualization of slope raster from TINItaly
- Shows terrain complexity across study area
- Includes slope statistics (mean, median, max)
- **Output:** `terrain_slope.png`

### 12.8 Reference DEM Comparison
- Multi-panel comparison:
  - TINItaly DEM
  - Copernicus DEM
  - Difference map (TINItaly - Copernicus)
  - Statistics panel
- Shows differences between reference DEMs themselves
- **Output:** `reference_dem_comparison.png`

### 12.9 Coverage Grid and Void Zones
- Creates coverage grid showing SAOCOM measurement density
- Identifies void zones (areas without measurements)
- Overlays void zones on terrain slope
- Coverage statistics (% covered, void cells, etc.)
- **Output:** `coverage_and_voids.png`

### 12.10 Residuals by Elevation Bins
- Analyzes if accuracy varies with elevation
- Bins data by elevation range (0-200m, 200-400m, etc.)
- Shows NMAD and sample counts for each elevation range
- **Output:** `accuracy_by_elevation.png`

### 12.11 Summary Dashboard
- Comprehensive 9-panel dashboard:
  1. Spatial distribution of points
  2. Residual histogram with NMAD
  3. NMAD by slope category
  4. Scatter plot (SAOCOM vs TINItaly)
  5. Terrain slope map
  6. Spatial residuals map
  7. Statistics summary text panel
- Everything in one figure for presentations/papers
- **Output:** `summary_dashboard.png`
