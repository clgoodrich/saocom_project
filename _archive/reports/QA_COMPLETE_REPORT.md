## Known Data Characteristics

### CORINE Land Cover Codes

The CORINE data in this project uses standard codes (expected behavior):

```
Standard CORINE Level 3 codes (100-600):
- 100-199: Artificial Surfaces
- 200-299: Agricultural Areas
- 300-399: Forest & Semi-Natural
- 400-499: Wetlands
- 500-599: Water Bodies
```

The notebook includes complete CORINE class definitions and color mappings for all standard classes.

### SAOCOM Data

```
Points: 68,512 (may vary by dataset)
Coordinates: Uses LAT2/LON2 preferentially (highest precision)
Height: Relative values requiring calibration
Coherence: Quality metric (0-1 range)
```

## Differences from saocom_analysis_clean.ipynb

The `saocom_analysis_clean.ipynb` was an earlier attempt that had INCOMPLETE functionality:

**Missing from clean version:**
- Void zone analysis
- Swiss cheese visualization
- Full land cover analysis (only had basic Level 1)
- Individual class overlay maps
- Topographic maps
- 3D models
- Many visualization sections
- Complete CORINE processing pipeline

**saocom_analysis_complete.ipynb includes ALL of these sections.**

## How to Use

### 1. Activate Environment

```bash
cd C:\Users\colto\Documents\GitHub\saocom_project
# Activate your Python environment if using one
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook saocom_analysis_complete.ipynb
```

### 3. Execute Cells

Option A: Run all cells
- Kernel → Restart & Run All

Option B: Run cells sequentially
- Execute cells from top to bottom
- Review outputs as you go

### 4. Check Outputs

```bash
# Check results directory
ls results/

# Check images directory
ls images/
```

---

## Expected Execution Time

Based on data size (68,512 points):

- Data loading: ~10 seconds
- DEM resampling: ~30 seconds
- Sampling and calibration: ~20 seconds
- Outlier detection: ~30 seconds
- Land cover processing: ~60 seconds
- Visualizations: ~2-5 minutes
- **Total: ~5-10 minutes**

Times may vary based on system performance.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`:
```bash
pip install geopandas rasterio shapely scipy scikit-learn scikit-image seaborn matplotlib_scalebar dbfread
```

### File Not Found Errors

Verify data files exist:
```bash
ls data/saocom_csv/*.csv
ls data/tinitaly/*.tif
ls data/copernicus*.tif
ls data/ground_cover/*.tif
ls data/sentinel_data/*.tif
```

### Memory Issues

If you encounter memory errors:
- Close other applications
- Run cells individually instead of all at once
- Clear outputs: Cell → All Output → Clear
